Print settings will be listed below:
- Brim
- PLA filament
- 15% infill
- 0.30mm Draft speed
- Support on build plate: ORGANIC supports

#### Post-Fabrication Steps
Insert one 5x2mm and two 5x5mm press-fit cubes into one half of the wizard staff. Apply epoxy or super glue to one half of wizard staff and clamp the two sides together, ensuring that the press-fit cubes align with their slots on the other half. Wait approximately 24 hrs for the adhesive to fully dry. **Keep halves clamped together**.

## Wizard Staff V2
The second wizard staff is custom modeled using inspiration of round-based, softer designs from fantasy-based movies, tv shows, and games. Post-fabrication steps are required. Print this staff in tangent with the [Press-Fit Cubes](#press-fit-cubes).

Print settings will be listed below:
- Brim
- PLA filament
- 15% infill
- 0.30mm Draft speed
- Support on build plate: ORGANIC supports

#### Post-Fabrication Steps
Insert one 5x2mm and two 5x5mm press-fit cubes into one half of the wizard staff. Apply epoxy or super glue to one half of wizard staff and clamp the two sides together, ensuring that the press-fit cubes align with their slots on the other half. Wait approximately 24 hrs for the adhesive to fully dry. **Keep halves clamped together**.

## Press-Fit Cubes
The press-fit cubes will allow you to connect and adhere the two halves of the 3D printed staffs together. Use these cubes in tangent with epoxy or super glue to ensure that the staffs will not break apart easily.

Below are images of the two types of press-fit cubes:
